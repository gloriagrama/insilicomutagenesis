# _in silico_ Mutagenesis

ML model Enformer used to determine potential regulatory regions by sequential python string manipulation of the GATA3 locus, a gene involved in T-cell differentiation. The GATA3 sequence was centered along its transcription start site (TSS) with approximately 100Kb up and downstream. Enformer code was taken from the colab found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/deepmind_research/blob/master/enformer/enformer-usage.ipynb#scrollTo=gM2KwV8gwMNj). All perturbations, bootstrapping, statistical analyses, and modelling can be found in the attached notebook.
