# _in silico_ Mutagenesis

The state of the art ML model Enformer was used to determine potential regulatory regions. in silico muatagenesis (ISM) was conducted in a fashion closely replicated CRISPR tiling deletion screens. The GATA3 sequence was centered along its transcription start site (TSS) with approximately 100Kb up and downstream. Enformer code was taken from the colab found [here]([url](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/deepmind_research/blob/master/enformer/enformer-usage.ipynb#scrollTo=gM2KwV8gwMNj))
